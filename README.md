Biochar Star

Biochar Star is a webpage for a future business.  The webpage submitted in class is an educational webpage for biochar.  I will  transition it to a business webpage in the future that sells biochar and related items.  

CSS 

I adjusted in css for mobile and desktop usage.  On the main navigation I included a float and and bottom and top margins.  

The classes I created are: header and footer sections.
I added padding and  background color changes for the header and footer section.  

I used boot strap to organize the column views based on mobile or desktop usage.  



Custom javaScript functions
 I created user forms.  The javascript functions  checked email validation. 

Media queries:
Media queries were created to build the website mobile first. 

Accessibility:  I followed best practices to ensure that the website was accessible for those users with slower internet connections. The html, css , and javascript was loaded in that order in order to allow for faster accesss.   I labeled
all buttons and images within accessibility protocols.
